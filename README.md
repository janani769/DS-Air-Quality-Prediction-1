# 🌫️ Air Quality Prediction & Analysis Website

This project is a user-friendly web application built to **analyze, visualize, and predict Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning and time-series data techniques. It supports environmental insight and early warning systems for pollution spikes through powerful data science tools and intuitive visualizations.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Air pollution remains a global health and environmental threat, particularly in urban areas. Traditional monitoring is often expensive and lacks predictive power. This project leverages **machine learning regression models** to forecast AQI using pollutant and meteorological data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict AQI using PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and date.
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
- Visualize pollutant trends and forecast AQI values using regression models.
- Compare performance of models like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**.
- Extract feature importance to understand key pollution drivers.
